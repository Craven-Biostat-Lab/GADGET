    <p>GADGET (Genes Associated by Documents, Genes, Events, and Text) is a tool that allows users to search and navigate the biomedical literature that is associated with specific genes.  GADGET can identify the genes that are strongly associated with arbitrary text queries, and it can also show "events" that describe automatically extracted relationships among the genes.</p>
    <p>GADGET has two main views: The <a href="gadget/genesearch">gene search</a> sifts through literature to identify genes associated with user queries.  The <a href="gadget/eventsearch">event search</a> sifts through interactions between genes that have been automatically extracted from biomedical abstracts.</p>

    <a class="topic" name="genesearch">The gene search</a>
    <p>GADGET's gene search returns genes that are associated with the abstracts in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank">PubMed</a> that match a given query.  When you search on a phrase, GADGET will return a list of genes related to that phrase in the literature, ordered by the approximate "importance" of the phrase for each gene: if you search for "<a href="gadget/genesearch?q=surfactant">surfactant</a>," genes for which "surfactant" is more strongly associated will appear higher in the list.</b>
    <p>There are several different scores that GADGET can use to the rank genes that satisfy a given query.  (Read about them <a href="#scores">here</a>.)  To change which score GADGET uses to sort the genes, just click on the name of that score in the result table header.</p>
    <p>To see a list of abstracts for a gene that match your query, click on the plus sign ("+") on the left side of the gene's table row.  You can also see events for the gene this way.</p>

    <a href="/" class="top">Back to GADGET</a>

    <a class="topic" name="queryterms">Entering query terms</a>
    <p>To search for genes or events, you can enter one or more key terms.  GADGET searches for abstracts that contain your query terms, and then links them to genes or events.  Query terms in GADGET are not case sensitive (although Boolean operators are).</p>
    <p>You will often get better results by using more specific terms in your searches.  Avoid using common terms like "gene" in your query; they don't usually add much value to the results, and they can slow down GADGET.</p>
    <p>GADGET supports Boolean queries for more specific searches.  Terms can be separated with <span class="example">AND</span> and <span class="example">OR</span>.  An <span class="example">AND</span> query will match abstracts that contain both terms, while an <span class="example">OR</span> query will match abstracts that contain either term.  Terms separated by spaces are automatically treated as an <span class="example">AND</span> query.  You can also exclude terms from your query by using <span class="example">NOT</span> followed by the term.  You can use parentheses to make complex Boolean queries.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <div class="example">Match genes or events referenced in abstracts matching both "Cat" and "Dog":<br /><span>Cat AND Dog</span> or just <span>Cat Dog</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match genes or events referenced in abstracts matching "Cat" or "Dog", but not "Fish":<br /><span>Cat OR Dog NOT Fish</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match genes or events referenced in abstracts matching "Cat", or both "Dog" and "Fish":<br /><span>Cat OR (Dog AND Fish)</span></div>
    <p>To do an exact match on a multi-word phrase, enclose the phrase in quotes.</p>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing the terms "Embryonic", "Stem", and "Cell":<br /><span>Embryonic stem cell</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "Embryonic stem cell" all together:<br /><span>"Embryonic stem cell"</span></div>
    <p>You can also restrict abstracts by the year they were published by entering <span class="example">year:</span> followed by the year.  You can specify ranges of years by using <span class="example">year:[<u>startyear</u> to <u>endyear</u>]</span>.  You can leave either <u>startyear</u> or <u>endyear</u> blank for an open-ended range.</p>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts published in 2011:<br /><span>year:2011</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "apoptosis" published between 2005 and 2009 (inclusive):<br /><span>apoptosis year:[2005 to 2009]</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "surfactant" published in or before 2007:<br /><span>surfactant year:[to 2007]</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "chitin" published in or after 2009:<br /><span>chitin year:[2009 to]</span></div>
    <p>GADGET accepts wildcards to match inexact terms.  Including a question mark (<span class="example">?</span>) in a term will match any single character, while an asterisk (<span class="example">*</span>) will match any number of arbitrary characters.  Note that using a wildcard character at the beginning of a term will significantly slow GADGET down.  You cannot use wildcard characters within quotation marks.</p>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "text", "test", etc.:<br /><span>te?t</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "BLAST", "blastula", "blastema", etc.:<br /><span>blast*</span></div>
    <p>GADGET uses the <a href="http://packages.python.org/Whoosh/querylang.html" target="_blank">Whoosh query language</a> for matching abstracts.  Not all features of the query language are applicable to GADGET.</p>

<a class="topic" name="scores">Gene search scores</a>
    <p>In the gene-search, GADGET can use different scores to determine which genes are most important to your query.</p>
    <p>When you do a search, GADGET finds all of the abstracts that match your query, and then finds genes that are mentioned in those abstracts.  GADGET computes scores for each gene based upon: the number of abstracts matching the query for each gene, the total number of abstracts associated with each gene, and the total number of abstracts matching the query.</p>
    <p>Each of the available scores takes some of these factors into account in different ways.  You can rank the genes by a score by clicking on the score's name in the table header.</p>
    <table class="instructions">
        <tr><td>F1 score</td><td>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score" target="_blank">F1 score</a> is a balanced measurement of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall" target="_blank">precision and recall</a>.  It takes both the proportion of matching abstracts for each gene and the total number of matching abstracts into account.  The F1 score represents a tradeoff between the "Adjusted precision" and "Matching abstracts" scores.  This score is used by default.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Adjusted precision</td><td>The adjusted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_%28information_retrieval%29" target="_blank">precision</a> score is based upon the proportion of a gene's abstracts that match your query.  For each gene in your query, adjusted precision is calculated as (number of abstracts for the gene matching the query) / (10 + total number of abstracts for the gene).  The precision is adjusted by adding a "pseudocount" of 10 to the denominator, so that a gene with 10/10 matching abstracts scores higher than a gene with 1/1 matching abstracts.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Matching abstracts</td><td>"Matching abstracts" is the number of abstracts for the gene that match your query.  This score is useful for finding genes that have larger amounts of published literature relevant to your query, but genes with more total abstracts tend to be ranked higher even if they are less relevant to your query.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Total abstracts</td><td>"Total abstracts" shows the total number of abstracts associated with each gene.  This number does not change based upon your query.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>GADGET also computes a p-value for each gene using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_test" target="_blank">hypergeometric test</a>.  The null hypothesis for the test is that the fraction of abstracts that match the query for a given gene is equal to the "background" fraction of abstracts that match the query in the entire corpus of abstracts.  The p-value thus indicates how confident we are that a gene's abstract set is enriched for the query.</p>

    <a class="topic" name="genesearch_via_querystring">Accessing the gene search without a browser</a>
    <p>If you want to automatically access GADGET's gene search without using a web browser, you can download comma-delimited CSV files by fetching <span class="example">http://gadget.biostat.org/gadget/genelist?download=True&</span> and sending arguments via the query string of the URL.</p>
    <p>To send information to GADGET, just append it to the url.  Aguments are given by the name of the argument, an equals sign (<span class="example">=</span>), and the argument's value, e.g. <span class="example"><u>argument</u>=<u>value</u></span>.  Multiple arguments should be separated by ampersands (<span class="example">&</span>).  Here's a list of the arguments you can send:</p>
    <table class="instructions">
        <tr><td>q</td><td>The query terms of your search.  This argument <b>must</b> be included.<br /><br />In most browsers, you can include spaces and quotation marks in the URL.  Special characters, like "&" and "/", must be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_reserved_characters" target="_blank">percent encoded</a>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>orderby</td><td>Which score to use to rank the results.<br /><br />There are 4 possible values for <span>orderby</span>.  The possible values are <span>f1_score</span>, which will order the genes by the F1 score; <span>precision</span>, which will order the genes by the adjusted precision; <span>hits</span>, which will order the genes by the number of abstracts matching your query; and <span>abstracts</span>, which will order the genes by the total number of abstracts for each gene.<br /><br />If the <span>orderby</span> argument is omitted or invalid, GADGET will default to the F1 score.  See <a href="#scores">above</a> for more information about the different scores.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>limit</td><td>The maximum number of genes to return.  This argument should be a number.  If <span>limit</span> is not included or is invalid, GADGET will return all of the genes found in the search.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>offset</td><td>The rank (minus one) of the first gene to include in the results.  To omit the first 100 genes, include <span>offset=100&</span>.  If <span>offset</span> is omitted or invalid, GADGET will not omit any genes.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>download</td><td>This argument must be present to download the results as a CSV file.  If <span>download</span> is omitted, the results will be returned as HTML.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>If no abstracts or genes match your query, or if <span class="example">q</span> is omitted or invalid, the GADGET server will issue a 404 error instead of returning a CSV file.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <div class="example">Download a CSV of genes matching "arteriole":<br /><span>http://gadget.biostat.wisc.edu/gadget/genelist?download=True&<b>q=arteriole</b></span></div>
    <div class="example">Download a CSV of genes matching "mesoderm", ranked by adjusted precision:<br /><span>http://gadget.biostat.wisc.edu/gadget/genelist?download=True&<b>q=mesoderm&orderby=precision</b></span></div>

    <a class="topic" name="eventsearch">The event search</a>
    <p>The GADGET <a href="/gadget/eventsearch">event search</a> allows you to browse through events describing interactions among genes.  Events are changes in states of biomolecules, and are automatically extracted from abstracts using natural language processing algorithms.  Using the event search, you can learn about other genes that interact with a given gene, or gene interactions that are relevant to a keyword query.</p>
    <p>The set of events we consider comes from the <a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/SharedTask/" target="_blank">BioNLP '09</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst/" target="_blank">BioNLP '11</a> Shared Task.  The task defines an event as "a change on the state of a bio-molecule or bio-molecules, e.g. phosphorylation of IkB involves a change on the protein IkB."  The GADGET database only includes events that refer to more than one gene.</p>
    <p>There are (currently) 9 different event types: gene expression, transcription, protein catabolism, localization, binding, phosphorylation, regulation, positive regulation, and negative regulation.  Each event has one or more component "themes," which can be genes, or other events.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that event extraction software is not perfectly accurate, so the set of events in the GADGET database is incomplete and contains some incorrect events.  It is important to read each event's abstract(s) when using events to learn about gene interactions.</p>
    <p>GADGET uses events from the Turku NLP Group's <a href="http://bionlp.utu.fi/pubmedevents.html" target="_blank">EVEX dataset</a>.  Additional sets of events will be added in the future.</p>

<a class="topic" name="eventqueries">Querying events</a>
    <p>You can <a href="#geneentry">enter one or more gene names</a> to display associated events.  <a href="#queryterms">Term queries</a> (entered in the same way as the gene search) first find abstracts that match the query, and then display events from those abstracts.  Gene and keyphrase queries can be used together in combination.</p>
    <p>For each event, GADGET will show you a <a href="#diagrams">diagram</a> of the event, a list of genes referenced in the event, the event type (or types), and a list of abstracts that describe the event.</p>
    <p>To narrow down the list of events, you can add genes to your query.  Click on <i>"See a list of genes referenced by these events..."</i> to see which genes are referenced by events in your query, and how many events each gene is referenced by.  Click on a gene to restrict your results to events that include that gene.</p>

    <a class="topic" name="geneentry">Searching for specific genes</a>
    <p>In the event search, you can search for events tied to specific genes.  Genes should be entered using their <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene" target="_blank">Entrez Gene</a> symbols.  Use commas to separate multiple genes.  Gene symbols are not case sensitive.</p>
    <p>You can also see events for specific genes by clicking on a gene symbol in the event search or the gene search.  In the event search, you can see a list of genes referenced by events in your search, and click on one to see only events that reference that gene.</p>
    <a href="#top" class="top">Back to top</a>
    <a href="/" class="top">Back to GADGET</a>    

    <a class="topic" name="diagrams">Event diagrams</a>
    <p>When you do an event search, GADGET displays diagrams of the events using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph" target="_blank">factor-graph</a>-like representation.  In the diagram, blue circles (nodes) represent genes, and lines between circles (edges) represent events.</p>
    <p>For complex events, GADGET represents subevents as purple circles.  E.g. if an edge for a regulation event connects to a circle for a binding event, that event can be interpreted as regulation of binding.</p>
    <p>Some events have a direction, such as regulation.  The thickness of the lines in the diagrams represent the directionality of the event.  The node connected the thin end of the line <i>causes</i> the node connected to the thick end of the line.  Other events, such as binding, do not have a direction (the line has uniform thickness.)</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <div class="example"><table>
        <tr><td><img src="/static/events/example1.png" /></td><td>ACTR6 binds to RHO (not directional).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><img src="/static/events/example2.png" /></td><td>TP53 regulates CDKN1A (directional).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><img src="/static/events/example3.png" /></td><td>BMP2 positively regulates the phosphorylation of SMAD1</td></tr>
