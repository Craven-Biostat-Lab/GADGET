    <p><a href="/">GADGET</a> (Genes Associated by Documents, Genes, Events, and Text) is a tool that allows users to search and navigate the biomedical literature that is associated with specific genes.  GADGET can identify the genes that are strongly associated with arbitrary text queries, and it can also show "events" that describe automatically extracted relationships among the genes.</p>
    <p>GADGET has two main views: The <a href="gadget/genesearch">gene search</a> sifts through literature to identify genes associated with a particular topic.  The <a href="gadget/eventsearch">event search</a> sifts through interactions between genes that have been automatically extracted from biomedical abstracts.</p>

    <a class="topic" name="genesearch">The gene search</a>
    <p>GADGET's gene search returns genes that are associated with the abstracts in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank">PubMed</a> that match a given query.  When you supply GADGET with a query, GADGET will return a list of genes related to your query in the literature, ordered by the approximate "importance" of the query for each gene: if you search for "<a href="gadget/genesearch?q=surfactant">surfactant</a>," genes for which "surfactant" is more strongly associated will appear higher in the list.</b>
    <p>GADGET gene search queries can include <a href="#queryterms">keyword searches</a>, lists of <a href="#geneentry">gene symbols</a>, a <a href="#species">species</a>, and an option to include <a href="#usehomologs">homologs</a>.  GADGET will find PubMed abstracts that match your keyword query and refer to all of the genes that you specify, and then return genes found in those abstracts.</p>
    <p>There are several different scores that GADGET can use to the rank genes that satisfy a given query.  (Read about them <a href="#scores">here</a>.)  To change which score GADGET uses to sort the genes, just click on the name of that score in the result table header.</p>
    <p>To see a list of abstracts for a gene that match your query, click on the "abstracts" icon (<img src="/static/document.png" />) on the left side of the gene's table row.  You can also see events for the gene this way.</p>
    <p>You can download gene search results as a CSV or XML.  When you download gene search results, the results will contain all of the genes that match your query, not just the genes displayed on the page.  The XML representation uses the DTD found <a href="/static/genelist.dtd" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <a class="topic" name="queryterms">Keyword queries</a>
    <p>To search for genes or events, you can enter one or more key terms.  GADGET searches for abstracts that contain your query terms, and then links them to genes or events.  Query terms in GADGET are not case sensitive (although Boolean operators are).</p>
    <p>You will often get better results by using more specific terms in your searches.  Avoid using common terms like "gene" in your query; they don't usually add much value to the results, and they can slow down GADGET.</p>
    <p>GADGET supports Boolean queries for more specific searches.  Terms can be separated with <span class="example">AND</span> and <span class="example">OR</span>.  An <span class="example">AND</span> query will match abstracts that contain both terms, while an <span class="example">OR</span> query will match abstracts that contain either term.  Terms separated by spaces are automatically treated as an <span class="example">AND</span> query.  You can also exclude terms from your query by using <span class="example">NOT</span> followed by the term.  You can use parentheses to make complex Boolean queries.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <div class="example">Match genes or events referenced in abstracts matching both "Cat" and "Dog":<br /><span>Cat AND Dog</span> or just <span>Cat Dog</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match genes or events referenced in abstracts matching "Cat" or "Dog", but not "Fish":<br /><span>Cat OR Dog NOT Fish</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match genes or events referenced in abstracts matching "Cat", or both "Dog" and "Fish":<br /><span>Cat OR (Dog AND Fish)</span></div>
    <p>To do an exact match on a multi-word phrase, enclose the phrase in quotes.</p>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing the terms "Embryonic", "Stem", and "Cell":<br /><span>Embryonic stem cell</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "Embryonic stem cell" all together:<br /><span>"Embryonic stem cell"</span></div>
    <p>You can also restrict abstracts by the year they were published by entering <span class="example">year:</span> followed by the year.  You can specify ranges of years by using <span class="example">year:[<u>startyear</u> to <u>endyear</u>]</span>.  You can leave either <u>startyear</u> or <u>endyear</u> blank for an open-ended range.</p>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts published in 2011:<br /><span>year:2011</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "apoptosis" published between 2005 and 2009 (inclusive):<br /><span>apoptosis year:[2005 to 2009]</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "surfactant" published in or before 2007:<br /><span>surfactant year:[to 2007]</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "chitin" published in or after 2009:<br /><span>chitin year:[2009 to]</span></div>
    <p>GADGET accepts wildcards to match inexact terms.  Including a question mark (<span class="example">?</span>) in a term will match any single character, while an asterisk (<span class="example">*</span>) will match any number of arbitrary characters.  Note that using a wildcard character at the beginning of a term will significantly slow GADGET down.  You cannot use wildcard characters within quotation marks.</p>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "text", "test", etc.:<br /><span>te?t</span></div>
    <div class="example">Match abstracts containing "BLAST", "blastula", "blastema", etc.:<br /><span>blast*</span></div>
    <p>GADGET uses the <a href="http://packages.python.org/Whoosh/querylang.html" target="_blank">Whoosh query language</a> for matching abstracts.  Not all features of the query language are applicable to GADGET.</p>

    <a class="topic" name="geneentry">Searching by gene symbol</a>
    <p>GADGET allows you to supply a list of genes for <a href="#genesearch">gene search</a> and <a href="#eventsearch">event search</a> queries.  When you supply a list of genes to GADGET's gene search, GADGET will show you a list of genes that co-occur with your input genes in PubMed abstracts.  When you provide a list of genes to GADGET's event search, GADGET will show you gene-interaction events that relate your input genes to each other and to other genes.</p>
    <p>Genes should be entered using their <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene" target="_blank">Entrez Gene</a> symbols.  Use commas to separate multiple genes.  Gene symbols are not case sensitive.</p>
    <p>For the gene search, GADGET will use your provided gene symbols to find genes for the selected species.  In the event search, GADGET finds human genes that match your gene symbols.</p>

    <a href="/" class="top">Back to GADGET</a>  


<a class="topic" name="scores">Gene search scores</a>
    <p>In the <a href="#genesearch">gene search</a>, GADGET can use different scores to determine which genes are most important to your query.</p>
    <p>When you do a search, GADGET finds all of the abstracts that match your query, and then finds genes that are mentioned in those abstracts.  GADGET computes scores for each gene based upon: the number of abstracts matching the query for each gene, the total number of abstracts associated with each gene, and the total number of abstracts matching the query.</p>
    <p>Each of the available scores takes some of these factors into account in different ways.  You can rank the genes by a score by clicking on the score's name in the table header.</p>
    <table class="instructions">
        <tr><td>F1 score</td><td>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score" target="_blank">F1 score</a> is a balanced measurement of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall" target="_blank">precision and recall</a>.  It takes both the proportion of matching abstracts for each gene and the total number of matching abstracts into account.  The F1 score represents a tradeoff between the "Adjusted precision" and "Matching abstracts" scores.  This score is used by default.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Adjusted precision</td><td>The adjusted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_%28information_retrieval%29" target="_blank">precision</a> score is based upon the proportion of a gene's abstracts that match your query.  For each gene in your query, adjusted precision is calculated as (number of abstracts for the gene matching the query) / (10 + total number of abstracts for the gene).  The precision is adjusted by adding a "pseudocount" of 10 to the denominator, so that a gene with 10/10 matching abstracts scores higher than a gene with 1/1 matching abstracts.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Matching abstracts</td><td>"Matching abstracts" is the number of abstracts for the gene that match your query.  This score is useful for finding genes that have larger amounts of published literature relevant to your query, but genes with more total abstracts tend to be ranked higher even if they are less relevant to your query.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Total abstracts</td><td>"Total abstracts" shows the total number of abstracts associated with each gene.  This number does not change based upon your query.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>GADGET also computes a <b>p-value</b> for each gene using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_test" target="_blank">hypergeometric test</a>.  The null hypothesis for the test is that the fraction of abstracts that match the query for a given gene is equal to the "background" fraction of abstracts that match the query in the entire corpus of abstracts.  The p-value thus indicates how confident we are that a gene's abstract set is enriched for the query.</p>

    <a class="topic" name="species">Selecting a species</a>
    <p>When you do a GADGET gene search, all of the genes in your results will be from a particular species.  GADGET allows you to select from several species to view genes for.  The currently-supported species are:
    <table>
        <tr><th>NCBI Taxonomy ID</th><th>Name</th></tr>
        <tr><td>9606</td><td>Homo Sapiens (default)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10090</td><td>Mus musculus</td></tr>
        <tr><td>559292</td><td>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</td></tr>
    </table></p>
    <p>For gene search queries, when you provide a list of <a href="#geneentry">gene symbols</a>, GADGET will match them to genes from your selected species.</p>
    <p>GADGET's <a href="#eventsearch">event search</a> does not take a species as input.  GADGET's event search currently uses only human genes (and homologs.)</p>

    <a class="topic" name="usehomologs">Optional inclusion of homologs</a>
    <p>When finding and <a href="#scores">scoring</a> genes that match your query, GADGET's gene search can optionally take homologs into account.  To calculate scores for each gene, GADGET counts the number of abstracts matching your query that each gene appears in.  If you choose to include homologs, GADGET will also count abstracts that refer to homologs of each gene.</p>
    <p>The groups of homologs that GADGET uses come from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene" target="_blank">Homologene</a>.  Homologs can be either from the same species as each gene, or from different species.</p>

    <a class="topic" name="genesearch_via_querystring">Using the gene search without a browser</a>
    <p>If you want to automatically access GADGET's gene search without using a web browser, you can download comma-delimited CSV or XML files by fetching <span class="example">http://gadget.biostat.org/gadget/genelist?</span> and sending arguments via the query string at the end of the URL.  To download data, the query string must include <span class="example">&download=CSV</span> or <span class="example">&download=XML</span>, depending on which format you want.</p>
    <p>To send information to GADGET, just append it to the url.  Aguments are given by the name of the argument, an equals sign (<span class="example">=</span>), and the argument's value, e.g. <span class="example"><u>argument</u>=<u>value</u></span>.  Multiple arguments should be separated by ampersands (<span class="example">&</span>).  Here's a list of the arguments you can send:</p>
    <table class="instructions">
        <tr><td>download</td><td>This argument is <b>required</b> to download the results as a CSV or XML file.  To download a CSV, use <span>&download=CSV</span>.

    <a class="topic" name="eventsearch">The event search</a>
    <p>The GADGET <a href="/gadget/eventsearch">event search</a> allows you to browse through events describing interactions among genes.  Events are changes in states of biomolecules, and are automatically extracted from abstracts using natural language processing algorithms.  Using the event search, you can learn about other genes that interact with a given gene, or gene interactions that are relevant to a keyword query.</p>
    <p>The set of events we consider comes from the <a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/SharedTask/" target="_blank">BioNLP '09</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst/" target="_blank">BioNLP '11</a> Shared Task.  The task defines an event as "a change on the state of a bio-molecule or bio-molecules, e.g. phosphorylation of IkB involves a change on the protein IkB."  The GADGET database only includes events that refer to more than one gene.</p>
    <p>There are (currently) 9 different event types: gene expression, transcription, protein catabolism, localization, binding, phosphorylation, regulation, positive regulation, and negative regulation.  Each event has one or more component "themes," which can be genes, or other events.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that event extraction software is not perfectly accurate, so the set of events in the GADGET database is incomplete and contains some incorrect events.  It is important to read each event's abstract(s) when using events to learn about gene interactions.</p>
    <p>GADGET uses events from the Turku NLP Group's <a href="http://bionlp.utu.fi/pubmedevents.html" target="_blank">EVEX dataset</a>.  Additional sets of events will be added in the future.</p>

    <a href="/" class="top">Back to GADGET</a>


<a class="topic" name="eventqueries">Querying events</a>
    <p>You can <a href="#geneentry">enter one or more gene names</a> to display associated events.  <a href="#queryterms">Term queries</a> (entered in the same way as the gene search) first find abstracts that match the query, and then display events from those abstracts.  Gene and keyphrase queries can be used together in combination.</p>
    <p>For each event, GADGET will show you a <a href="#diagrams">diagram</a> of the event, a list of genes referenced in the event, the event type (or types), and a list of abstracts that describe the event.</p>
    <p>To narrow down the list of events, you can add genes to your query.  Click on <i>"See a list of genes referenced by these events..."</i> to see which genes are referenced by events in your query, and how many events each gene is referenced by.  Click on a gene to restrict your results to events that include that gene.</p>
    <p>You can download event search results in XML or CSV formats.  The XML representation contains more information about the structures of the events, but CSV's are often easier to use.  You can download up to 500 events at a time.  The XML representation uses a DTD file that can be found <a href="/static/eventlist.dtd" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <a href="/" class="top">Back to GADGET</a>  


    <a class="topic" name="diagrams">Event diagrams</a>
    <p>When you do an event search, GADGET displays diagrams of the events using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph" target="_blank">factor-graph</a>-like representation.  In the diagram, blue circles (nodes) represent genes, and lines between circles (edges) represent events.</p>
    <p>For complex events, GADGET represents subevents as purple circles.  E.g. if an edge for a regulation event connects to a circle for a binding event, that event can be interpreted as regulation of binding.</p>
    <p>Some events have a direction, such as regulation.  The thickness of the lines in the diagrams represent the directionality of the event.  The node connected the thin end of the line <i>causes</i> the node connected to the thick end of the line.  Other events, such as binding, do not have a direction (the line has uniform thickness.)</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <div class="example"><table>
        <tr><td><img src="/static/events/example1.png" /></td><td>ACTR6 binds to RHO (not directional).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><img src="/static/events/example2.png" /></td><td>TP53 regulates CDKN1A (directional).</td></tr>
